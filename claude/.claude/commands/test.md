Write tests for $ARGUMENTS.

Requirements:
- Use the existing test framework in this project (detect from package.json, pyproject.toml, Cargo.toml, etc.)
- Cover happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names that explain what's being tested
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Keep tests focused and independent

If no test framework is configured, suggest one appropriate for the project.
