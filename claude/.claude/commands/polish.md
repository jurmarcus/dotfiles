Polish and enhance $ARGUMENTS.

Look for quick wins:
- Clearer variable/function names
- Simplify complex conditionals
- Extract magic numbers to constants
- Add missing error messages
- Improve log messages
- Small performance wins (early returns, short-circuits)
- Remove dead code or unused imports

Keep changes minimal and safe. Don't change behavior, just improve clarity and quality.
