Create a commit for the current staged changes.

Requirements:
- Follow conventional commits format (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:)
- First line: imperative mood, max 50 chars, no period
- Body (if needed): wrap at 72 chars, explain WHY not WHAT
- Reference issues if applicable

First, show me `git diff --staged` to understand the changes, then create an appropriate commit.
