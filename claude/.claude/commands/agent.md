Help me build an AI agent for: $ARGUMENTS

Consider:
1. **Architecture** - What LLM, tools, and memory does it need?
2. **Tools** - What capabilities should it have?
3. **Prompting** - What system prompt and instructions?
4. **Error handling** - How to handle failures gracefully?
5. **Testing** - How to verify it works correctly?

If building with Claude, consider using the Anthropic SDK directly or Claude Code's agent capabilities. For MCP integration, we can expose tools via an MCP server.

Suggest an implementation approach, then build it.
